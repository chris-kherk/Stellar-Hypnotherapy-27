The therapist might suggest new ways to cope with emotions or stress without turning to food. This process aims to reshape their relationship with food, promoting more mindful eating habits and reducing the urge to binge. Hypnosis offers a supportive environment where individuals can learn to take control of their eating behaviors positively and sustainably.
